    <li>3 cups all-pourpuse flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pizza toppings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Quarter cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
    <li>Quarter cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
</ul>

    <li><b>Step 1</b> Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li><b>Step 2</b> Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
    <li><b>Step 3</b> Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. </li>
    <li><b>Step 4</b> Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Step 5</b> Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. </li>
    <li><b>Step 6</b> Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
    <li><b>Step 7</b>  Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave. </li>
    <li><b>Step 8</b> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil. </li>
    <li><b>Step 9</b> Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick. </li>
    <li><b>Step 10</b> Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas. </li>
    <li><b>Step 11</b> Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust. </li>
    <li><b>Step 12</b> Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. </li>
    <li><b>Step 13</b> Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough. </li>
